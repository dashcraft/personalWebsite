# Of Ash And Fire Website Redesign

###Angular 2 (no, not 4)
I am currently using Angular 2 with a custom stylesheet and styleguide. I will include the
sketch files towards the end of the development process. I went with Angular 2 since there is currently good support in VS Code and the .Net environment for 2 as opposed to all the upgrade issues in Angular 4. Once the bugs are ironed out, will probably switch to v4, since there is minimal code change.
### ASP.NET Web API
I am using ASP.NET Web API so i can incorporate some of the cool microsoft analytics products into the website, purely for playing around. I am going to be streaming real time site analytics into Microsoft Event Hub and Power BI. This will also be available on the website towards the end of the development process.
### MSSQL
It's pretty much standard in my kneck of the woods and although i'd rather use a nosql database, there is such a demand in my market that this particular skillset is almost a requirement. I am also a huge proponent of MongoDB, RethinkDB, CouchDB, MariaDB and i've played with Amazon RDBMS, Postrgres and Elastic Search.
###Cloud Host All The Things
This website is made trying to follow SOA as much as possible. Although i will most likely not dockerize it, i am leaving it made so that creating images and breaking the services up will not be all that difficult.

#Get Started
###Mac or Windows?
I am using a mac, although i own a windows pc (it's 4 years old), because i find designing on it much easier. I don't own a new `insert random new pc` here, so a 2014 macbook pro with 16gb of ram serves me very well. I am using visual studio code for this project, i started using VS for Mac preview, but it failed miserably and almost all of the plugins are unsupported. I don't use many plugins, but something like a TypeScript compiler seems important. I didn't feel like playing with VS for 8 hours to get it to do something that should be as simple as clicking a button, so i went back to VS Code. Which, btw, is a fantastic development platform and i've had almost no issues with it.  

So if you are using a windows PC there may be some issues, i will have to open this project on my windows pc when i have some free time to give individual instructions.
